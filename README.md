# Natours Landing Page

We will build a modern looking landing page called Natours aptly named for Nature Tour Agency to attract visitors to learn more and hopefully sign up for mountain tour packages.

Advanced and cutting-edge CSS techologies used:
- clip-path, background-clip, mask-image, background-blend-mode, shape-outside, filter, backdrop-filter, object-fit, transform, column-count, hyphens, perspective, calc and more.
- Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition.
- Advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- CSS architecture: 7-1 rule, component-based design and BEM methodology.
- Sass: setting global variables, building for reusability, architecting CSS and managing media queries.
- NPM ecosystem: setting up development process to compile Sass and automatic browser reload, and create a build process to concatenate, prefix and compress CSS files.
- Modern responsive design: fluid grid, layout types, flexible images, using media queries to test for different screen widths, pixel densities and touch capabilities.
- Advanced responsive design workflows: mobile-first vs desktop-first strategies, selecting breakpoints, em vs rem units and feature queries to test for browser support.
- Responsive images for faster pageloads: resolution switching, density switching and art direction.
- SVG images: generate SVG sprite, changing SVG colors in CSS.
- Incorporate background video effect.
- Using Flexbox to layout elements on website.
